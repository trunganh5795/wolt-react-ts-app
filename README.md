# React and TypeScrpt App

## Description
This application calculates a deliver fee based on the cart value, delivery distance, amount of items and time of the day. 
To build this application HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, React and TypeScript has been used. Jest was used for testing components and some functions.

## Remark
I built this application with small components and I hope it will not be considered as over engineering or bloted code. Of course, it can be done in one or  a couple of components but to demonstrate separation of concern and single responsibility approach, I tried to split the application to tiny components.
## Start
